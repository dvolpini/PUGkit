A PICkit 2 clone with Arduino UNO form factor

Microchip is very commom in Latin America, especially in Brazil where I live!

But... Arduino is the revolution!!

So the idea is get the best of the two Worlds: use the PICs with de Arduino Shield.

The idea in a first moment is just  design the hardware (based in the PICkit 2) and still use the PICkit 2 Software.

After that, design an IDE software to program almost all 8 bits (even 16 bits) PIC with the Wiring/Arduino framework without the necessity of bootloaders.

The hardware will be released under Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 International.
